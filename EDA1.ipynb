They pour a fantastic glass of ice water and that's it! The bread on the table was harder than titanium. Maybe it wasn't supposed to be eaten just for decoration. The bacon appetizer doesn't even compare to Army MREs. I would say maybe on par with hospital food. The shrimp cocktail was just average until my waiter put his dirty sleeve in my plate...Thank you now its really tasty. I think the waitstaff was hired away from the KFC down the block.

They brought out tiny pieces of Oscar Meyer breakfast bacon. Eastern European waitstaff doesn't get the customer service thing either. save your money, boycott these average spots and lets keep NY restaurants on top.\", 'Rating': '2', 'Pros': 'easy to get a table because its awful', 'Cons': 'read the review'}, {'ReviewId': '1741279', 'UserType': 'Customer', 'Title': 'Hurry up and get to this place!', 'Username': 'chainsaw06', 'Date': '07/28/2006', 'TotalRatedHelpful': '\\n      ', 'TotalRated': '\\n      ', 'Body': \"Get there quick because by next week they will be selling all the fancy furniture and kitchen equipment on EBay! Where do I begin. They pour a fantastic glass of ice water and that's it! The bread on the table was harder than titanium. Maybe it wasn't supposed to be eaten just for decoration. The bacon appetizer doesn't even compare to Army MREs. I would say maybe on par with hospital food. The shrimp cocktail was just average until my waiter put his dirty sleeve in my plate...Thank you now its really tasty. I think the waitstaff was hired away from the KFC down the block.
